# Models

This directory contains conceptual, structural, and quantitative models related to regulatory systems and compliance architecture.

These models are designed to:

- Reveal latent governance risk
- Improve enterprise decision quality
- Anticipate catastrophic regulatory exposure
- Translate compliance signals into strategic insight

---

## Active Models

### 1. Latent Noncompliance Exposure Index (LNEI)

Purpose:
To quantify structural compliance exposure that may not yet be visible through enforcement actions.

Core Dimensions (Draft):
- Governance architecture strength
- Audit-to-remediation cycle time
- Cross-functional escalation velocity
- Enforcement density per revenue
- Regulatory complexity exposure

Status: Prototype Framework

---

### 2. Multi-Layer Compliance Signal Stack

A structural model distinguishing:

Layer 1 – Visible Enforcement (lagging signal)  
Layer 2 – Internal Audit Findings  
Layer 3 – Governance Structural Weakness  
Layer 4 – Cultural & Incentive Misalignment  

Status: Conceptual Design

---

### 3. Post-Event Compliance Drift Curve

A time-series model analyzing:
- Enforcement findings in years t-5 to t+5
- Regulatory scrutiny intensity shifts
- Governance adaptation velocity

Status: Research Design Phase

---

## Model Design Philosophy

Models prioritize:

- Transparency
- Interpretability
- Cross-industry applicability
- Executive usability

These are not black-box analytics tools.  
They are decision-support frameworks.
